Welcome to my website! I’m Yalın, a full-stack developer working at the software development department of RDC Partner, an outsourcing company based in Istanbul, Turkey. I've been in the software industry since I've got my degree on computer engineering from Kocaeli University in 2010, and during that time I've had experience in all layers of software and in various kinds of software from simple desktop apps to websites and to full-fledged cloud storage solutions.

I thrive in well-designed, well-designed and technology-rich software and I consider myself as language-agnostic because I can easily adapt to any programming language or paradigm in a short manner of time. To this date I've had professional experience in many programming languages and paradigms and I always strive to learn more.

My passion for software comes from my love for video games. Ever since I got my first computer (specifically, an Amiga 500) in 1993 I've been an avid fan of video games, and I always wondered how games were made. Even though I have a basic idea on how to make video games, I have no hands-on professional experience on the matter, but this is something I hope to fix in the future.

This blog is intended to be about both programming and gaming, and although it's not yet rich in content, this too will hopefully be fixed in the future.
